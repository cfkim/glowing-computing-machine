# My Personal Website (v2)
Website is live here!: https://cfkim.github.io/portfolio.github.io/

My Personal Website is a clean, organized, and straightforward website to showcase my projects and experience as a mobile developer.

It uses plain, vanilla HTML + CSS. This was a challenge for me to see my HTML and CSS skills which are fundamental to learning more complex frameworks like React. Up until this point I have used Chat GPT and a lot of Googling to help me learn basic web development skills and get projects running. But this time I decided to build a simple and sleek website with the knowledge I've gained so far and minimal Googling. It was quite rewarding since I remember struggling heavily with css and now I know how to identify issues and fix them on my own quickly. 
### Inspiration
Additionally, in this first release, I decided to use a pre-made Figma website wireframe as inspiration [here](https://www.figma.com/design/6vFWPvPk0krYZyIhoS7Zec/My-personal-website?node-id=77-432&node-type=canvas&t=BiuQdGoGNyO7riFe-0). I also received heavy inspiration from this portfolio website by Ben Rogers [here](https://www.benrogers.dev/#projects). I liked the grey scheme for a timeless and minimalistic look that resembles the branding of high end companies like Apple. If I wanted to change the theme, I can easily do so since I wrote my code in a very straightforward and organized way. This was a great learning experience and testament to having some firm grasp of HTML and CSS for myself. I also learned how valuable it is to have a wireframe or mock-up of the website before making it. This cut down on so much development time since I wasn't making design decisions while I coded simultaneously. The result is a cohesive, appealing website.
### Learnings
I didn't necessarily learn new things as much as I solidified a lot of things I've learned from previous web dev projects. This mainly includes flexbox layouts and creating a navbar on my own.
